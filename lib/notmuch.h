 * Store an mtime within the database for 'directory'.
 *
 * The 'directory' should be an object retrieved from the database
 * with notmuch_database_get_directory for a particular path.
 *
 * The intention is for the caller to use the mtime to allow efficient
 * identification of new messages to be added to the database. The
 * recommended usage is as follows:
 *
 *   o Read the mtime of a directory from the filesystem
 *
 *   o Call add_message for all mail files in the directory
 *
 *   o Call notmuch_directory_set_mtime with the mtime read from the
 *     filesystem.
 *
 * Then, when wanting to check for updates to the directory in the
 * future, the client can call notmuch_directory_get_mtime and know
 * that it only needs to add files if the mtime of the directory and
 * files are newer than the stored timestamp.
 *
 * Note: The notmuch_directory_get_mtime function does not allow the
 * caller to distinguish a timestamp of 0 from a non-existent
 * timestamp. So don't store a timestamp of 0 unless you are
 * comfortable with that.
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_SUCCESS: mtime successfully stored in database.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_XAPIAN_EXCEPTION: A Xapian exception
 *	occurred, mtime not stored.
 *
 * NOTMUCH_STATUS_READ_ONLY_DATABASE: Database was opened in read-only
 *	mode so directory mtime cannot be modified.
